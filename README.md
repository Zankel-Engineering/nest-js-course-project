# nest-js-course-project

In this course we'll be building a small REST API application - that's all about Coffee ‚òïÔ∏è

How the course is designed
The course is designed to be incremental.

If you're coding along, make sure to follow through all the lessons & chapters in order. That way you won't miss any tips, best-practices, or code setup's that we might use in future lessons.

Course Path
This course covers both SQL & NoSQL paths, but for us to adequately showcase fundamental concepts of both approaches and integrations.

IMPORTANT: If you are coding along with us, make sure to SAVE your progress after completing Chapter 2: Creating a REST API Application into a separate Branch, that way you can retrieve it and continue from *that* point, if/when you choose to code along through the MongoDB/Mongoose bonus chapter.
What are we building?
In our application we'll be covering a few key concepts:

Encapsulating features / business domain into their own modules
Creating CRUD endpoints for a "Coffee" Entity
Covering all the important building blocks of NestJS applications
Mastering Dependency Injection
Integrating with both SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases
Covering the basics of unit & e2e testing
...and so much more! üêà
